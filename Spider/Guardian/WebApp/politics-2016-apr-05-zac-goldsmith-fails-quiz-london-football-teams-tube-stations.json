    "body": "<p>Mohamed Abrini, a a key suspect <a href=\"x-gu:\/\/item\/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com\/items\/world\/ng-interactive\/2016\/mar\/24\/paris-and-brussels-the-links-between-the-attackers\">wanted in connection with the Paris attacks in November<\/a>, has been arrested in Belgium, police sources have confirmed to French media.<br \/><\/p> \n<p>Abrini, 31, has been on Europe\u2019s most wanted list since being identified as one of two suspects seen on CCTV travelling in a car two days before the attacks. Abrini, who is Belgian, was at the wheel of the Renault Clio that was later used by a team of gunmen in the atrocity.<\/p> \n<p>Unconfirmed reports said Abrini had been arrested in the borough of Anderlecht, next to the western district of <a href=\"x-gu:\/\/item\/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com\/items\/world\/2015\/nov\/15\/molenbeek-the-brussels-borough-in-the-spotlight-after-paris-attacks\">Molenbeek<\/a> which has become known for links to jihadism. <\/p> \n<p>The Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office said only that it had made several arrests related to last month\u2019s <a href=\"x-gu:\/\/list\/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com\/lists\/tag\/world\/brussels-attacks\">Brussels attacks<\/a>, and gave no further details.<\/p> \n<p>Abrini was seen on the road to Paris in the days before the November violence but disappeared before attackers killed 130 people in coordinated assaults at the national stadium, bars, restaurants and the Bataclan concert hall.<br \/><\/p> \n<p>Abrini travelled to Paris with <a href=\"x-gu:\/\/item\/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com\/items\/world\/2016\/mar\/18\/paris-attacks-suspect-salah-abdeslam-wounded-in-brussels-terror-raid-reports\">Salah Abdeslam<\/a>, who was his childhood friend and whose bar in Molenbeek he used to frequent. Abdeslam, whose elder brother blew himself up in the attacks, is believed to be the only survivor of the core team of Paris bombers. He is said to have intended to blow himself up but apparently backed out at the last minute.<\/p> \n<p>After leaving Abdeslam in France, Abrini returned to Brussels on the morning of 13 November, before the Paris attacks that evening. He had been on the run ever since.<\/p> \n<p>Abrini, who has Belgian and Moroccan nationality, grew up in Brussels and has a history of petty crime. His younger brother died in Syria in 2014 after joining Islamic State\u2019s francophone brigade. Abrini himself is believed to have travelled to Syria last summer.<\/p> \n<p>Abdeslam was arrested in Brussels two weeks ago, four days before Isis suicide bombers struck the city\u2019s airport and a metro station, killing 32 people. He is now awaiting extradition to France.<\/p> \n<p>There was no official comment on whether Abrini was also suspected of a connection to the Brussels attacks.<br \/><\/p> \n<p>Belgian police are continuing to search for a third bomber, known as the \u201cman in the hat\u201d, seen on security camera footage with two suicide bombers at Brussels airport on 22 March. The man left a bag containing a bomb before walking out of the terminal and crossing Brussels on foot. <\/p> \n<p>On Thursday authorities released photos and video of a man wearing a dark hat leaving the airport on foot, walking to the nearby town of Zaventem and then into Brussels, where all traces of him were reportedly lost.<\/p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cf2b2f4f18326794c2c07c9381fea3baaa7a7ea\"> \n <img src=\"https:\/\/media.guim.co.uk\/8cf2b2f4f18326794c2c07c9381fea3baaa7a7ea\/0_14_1024_614\/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CCTV images of the \u2018man in the hat\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" \/> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CCTV images of the \u2018man in the hat\u2019.<\/span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP\/Getty Images<\/span> \n <\/figcaption> \n<\/figure> \n<p>There has been media speculation that Abrini could be the man in the hat, but there has been no official confirmation. Associated Press quoted a police source as saying Abrini was believed to be the man in the hat. But AFP cited police sources as saying investigators had considered the possibility of Abrini being the man in the hat and that nothing had appeared to come of it.<\/p> \n<p>The Belgian investigation has already established links between a large group of men \u2013 many of them childhood friends or brothers \u2013 who are suspected of playing different roles in both the Paris and Brussels attacks , the two biggest terror attacks carried out in Europe by Isis.<\/p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu:\/\/item\/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com\/items\/world\/2016\/mar\/23\/belgium-awkward-questions-bombers-links-to-paris-terror-cell\">Najim Laachraoui<\/a>, 24, who grew up in Brussels, was one of two jihadis who blew themselves up at Brussels airport after ordering a taxi from a flat that had been used as a makeshift bomb laboratory. He was also a suspected Isis recruiter and bomb-maker whose DNA was found on two explosives belts used in the Paris attacks.<\/p> \n<p>Khalid el-Bakraoui, 27, who blew himself up on the Brussels metro shortly after his elder brother Ibrahim had detonated a suicide vest at Brussels airport, was also suspected of playing some kind of logistics role in the Paris attacks. He had rented, under a false name, an apartment in the Forest area of Brussels where police hunting Abdeslam killed a gunman. <\/p> \n<p>He is also believed to have rented a safehouse in the southern Belgian city of Charleroi used by more of the Paris cell before the November attacks.<\/p>",
