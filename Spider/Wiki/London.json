A report by the McKinsey Global Institute published in 2012 estimated that London had a city GDP of US$751.8 billion in 2010, compared to US$764.2 billion for Paris, making them respectively the sixth- and fifth-largest in the world.

The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the [[London County Council]] was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. [[German strategic bombing during World War I|London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War]] while during the Second World War, [[the Blitz]] and other bombings by the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] were held at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], at a time when London had barely recovered from the war.\n\nIn 1951, the [[Festival of Britain]] was held on the [[South Bank]]. The [[Great Smog]] of 1952 led to the [[Clean Air Act 1956]], which ended the \"[[pea soup fog]]s\" for which London had been notorious. From the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of [[immigrants]], largely from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Jamaica]], India, [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]], making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.\n\n[[File:London Thames (1930).jpg|thumb|left|A view from Victoria Tower, in late 1920s]]\nPrimarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide [[youth culture]], exemplified by the [[Swinging London]] subculture associated with the [[King's Road]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Carnaby Street]]. The role of trendsetter was revived during the [[punk rock|punk]] era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new [[Greater London Council]] was created. During [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the [[Provisional IRA]]. Racial inequality was highlighted by the [[1981 Brixton riot]].\n\nGreater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6&nbsp;million in 1939 to around 6.8&nbsp;million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]], with the [[London Docklands]] area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the [[Canary Wharf]] development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The [[Thames Barrier]] was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the [[North Sea]].\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the [[Greater London Authority]]. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the [[Millennium Dome]], [[London Eye]] and [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] were constructed.
