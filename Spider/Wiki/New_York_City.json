He proceeded to sail up what he named the ''[[Hudson River|North River]]'', also called the ''Mauritis River'', and now known as the [[Hudson River]], to the site of the present-day New York State capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in the belief that it might represent an oceanic [[tributary]]. When the river narrowed and was no longer [[saline water|saline]], he realized it was not a maritime passage and sailed back downriver.
